🫀 __Heart Disease Prediction Project__
           
◼️ __Introduction__

This project is done as part of my Artificial Intelligence course assignment.
The main goal of this project is to understand how machine learning models can be used to analyze medical data and help in predicting heart disease.

In this project, I used a Heart Disease dataset and applied both:

•	Regression (to study relationships between features)

•	Classification (to predict whether a person has heart disease or not)

All the work is done in Python using Google Colab.

⚛️ __Dataset Information__

The dataset contains medical records of patients. Each row represents one patient, and each column represents a medical feature.

Some important attributes in the dataset are:
•	Age of the 

•	Gender (male/female)

•	Chest pain type

•	Resting blood pressure

•	Cholesterol level

•	Maximum heart rate achieved

•	Exercise-induced angina

•	Other clinical measurements

•	Target column (0 = No heart disease, 1 = Heart disease)

The dataset is provided in CSV format and uploaded directly into Google Colab.

⬇️ __What I Did in This Project__

1. __Data Exploration__
   
•	Loaded the dataset using pandas

•	Displayed the first 20 rows to understand the data

•	Checked column names, data types, and missing values

2. __Data Preprocessing__

•	Handled missing values (if any)

•	Converted categorical values into numeric form

•	Prepared the dataset for machine learning models

3. __Regression Analysis__
   
•	Applied Linear Regression

•	Used it to analyze how different features relate to heart disease values

•	Evaluated the model using:

o	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

o	Mean Squared Error (MSE)

o	R² Score

4. __Classification Model__
   
•	Applied Logistic Regression for prediction

•	Predicted whether a patient has heart disease or not

•	Evaluated the model using:

o	Confusion Matrix

o	Accuracy

o	Precision

o	Recall

5. __Visualization__
   
* Plotted graphs to visualize regression results
  
•Used confusion matrix to clearly show classification performance

⏰ __Results and Observations__

•	Regression helped in understanding the effect of medical features

•	Classification model performed well in predicting heart disease

•	Confusion matrix clearly shows correct and incorrect predictions

•	The project shows how AI can be useful in healthcare analysis

▶️ __How to Run This Project__

1.	Open the Google Colab notebook
	
2.	Upload the dataset file (heart.csv)
	
3.	Run all cells one by one
	
4.	Output tables, metrics, and graphs will be displayed

⚛️ __Tools Used__

•	Python

•	Pandas

•	NumPy

•	Scikit-learn

•	Matplotlib

•	Google Colab

⬛ __Conclusion__

This project helped me understand how regression and classification models work on real medical data.
It also improved my understanding of evaluation metrics like MAE, R² score, and confusion matrix.
